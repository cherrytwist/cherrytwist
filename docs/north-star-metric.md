#### Why a North Star Metric?
It is important for a company to be aware of its performance and growth. A North Star Metric should represent the growth of a company on it’s core value. This metric will help the company could adjust its strategy and communicate its performance. 

#### North Star Metric requirements
A few requirements are written down to which the Alkemio North Star Metric must comply.
- It should be very simple: anyone (investors, partners) should be able to understand it
- It should not require any explanation
- It should be independent of platform developments like new features
- It should match with Alkemio's purpose: getting an active community to work together onSubspaces and make impact

#### Proposed North Star Metric
The metric that matches all these requirements is the Monthly Active Users (MAU).
Where a user is active when it made any contribution on the platform, where contributions are the following:
1.	Created Subspace / Subspace
2.	Created Callout
3.	Response to Callout (new comment, new card, new canvas, comment on card, edit canvas)
4.	Wrote an update
5.	Changed Space / Subspace / Subspace content
6.	Joined Space / Subspace / Subspace

Numbers 1 – 5 are active contributions, as they reflect the addition of knowledge to the ecosystem. Taking part in a Space, Subspace or Subspace can also be seen as a contribution: a user therewith grows the visible community on that topic and increases its exposure to other users. 

#### Tracking the North Star Metric
The North Star Metric will be tracked on the platform level, and also for each Space.
